   - Ensure chronological ordering is preserved
   - Validate sequential user interaction patterns

2. **SS4Rec Training Execution**
   - Run Neural CF baseline training first
   - Execute SS4Rec training with temporal sequences
   - Compare validation RMSE results (target: SS4Rec < 0.70 vs NCF ~0.87)

3. **Model Performance Validation**
   - Validate SS4Rec learns temporal patterns correctly
   - Confirm sequential modeling advantages over Neural CF
   - Document training metrics and convergence

### **Training Commands Ready:**
```bash
# Neural CF Baseline
python auto_train_ss4rec.py --model ncf

# SS4Rec SOTA Training  
python auto_train_ss4rec.py --model ss4rec
```

## 🔄 **Phase 3: MLOps & CI/CD Pipeline (FUTURE)**

### **MLOps Architecture Vision:**

```
TRAINING PHASE:
├── Train Set (64%) → Model Training
└── Val Set (16%) → Training Evaluation & Early Stopping

PRODUCTION SIMULATION PHASE:
└── Test Set (20%) → "New Real Data" Simulation
    ├── Drift Detection
    ├── Performance Monitoring  
    └── Retraining Triggers
```

### **Key MLOps Features to Implement:**

#### **Data Drift Detection System**
- **User Behavior Drift**: Interaction pattern changes
- **Item Popularity Drift**: Movie preference shifts
- **Rating Distribution Drift**: Scoring pattern changes
- **Temporal Pattern Drift**: Seasonal/trend changes

#### **Automated Retraining Pipeline**
```yaml
# Future CI/CD Triggers
triggers:
  - test_set_performance_degradation
  - scheduled_monthly_retraining
  - manual_retrain_request

workflow:
  1. Detect drift in test set performance
  2. GitHub Actions automatically triggered
  3. Retrain model with updated temporal splits
  4. A/B test new model vs current model
  5. Deploy if performance improves
```

#### **Model Monitoring Dashboard**
- Real-time RMSE tracking on test set
- Drift detection alerts
- Training history and model versioning
- Performance comparison (SS4Rec vs NCF vs new models)

#### **Production Deployment**
- Model serving API (FastAPI)
- Real-time inference with SS4Rec
- Shadow mode testing
- Gradual rollout capabilities

## 📝 **Notes & Decisions**

### **Temporal Split Strategy:**
- **Rationale**: Chronological splits prevent data leakage and simulate real production scenarios
- **Architecture**: Train (64%) + Val (16%) for model development, Test (20%) for production simulation
- **MLOps Ready**: Test set becomes "new data" for drift detection and retraining triggers

### **Model Selection Justification:**
- **SS4Rec chosen**: 2025 SOTA for sequential recommendation
- **Temporal modeling**: Handles irregular interaction intervals
- **Paper adaptation**: Modified for rating prediction (vs original ranking task)

### **Discord Integration:**
- Maintained compatibility with existing auto-training workflow
- Enhanced notifications for model comparison
- Ready for MLOps alerting integration
