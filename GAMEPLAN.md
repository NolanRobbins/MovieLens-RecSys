    """
    Returns (should_retrain: bool, reason: str)
    """
    # Critical business impact - immediate retraining
    if metrics['ctr_drop'] >= 0.15 and metrics['days_sustained'] >= 7:
        return True, "CRITICAL: CTR dropped 15%+ for 7+ days"
    
    if metrics['session_duration_decline'] >= 0.20 and metrics['days_sustained'] >= 14:
        return True, "CRITICAL: Session duration declined 20%+ for 14+ days"
    
    # Multiple technical indicators - schedule retraining
    technical_failures = sum([
        metrics['rmse_increase'] >= 0.05,
        metrics['precision_at_10_decline'] >= 0.10,
        metrics['ndcg_decline'] >= 0.08
    ])
