# Expected performance with this config:
# - Batch size: 1024 (4x increase from stable 256)
# - Sequence length: 100 (2x increase from stable 50)  
# - Dataset: ~850K samples (controlled by max_sequences_per_user=5)
# - Batches per epoch: ~830 (850K / 1024)
# - Expected GPU utilization: 75-90% (major improvement)
# - Expected epoch time: 10-15 minutes (vs 276 hours original)
# - Mixed precision: DISABLED (prevents NaN crashes)
# - Training stability: HIGH (FP32 + tight gradient clipping)
