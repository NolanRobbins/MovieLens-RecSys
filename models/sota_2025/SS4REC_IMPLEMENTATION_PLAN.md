# SS4Rec Implementation Plan for MovieLens

## 🎯 **Model Choice: SS4Rec (Continuous-Time Sequential Recommendation with State Space Models)**

**Paper**: "SS4Rec: Continuous-Time Sequential Recommendation with State Space Models" (Feb 2025)
**ArXiv**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08132
**GitHub**: https://github.com/XiaoWei-i/SS4Rec

## 🏆 **Why SS4Rec for MovieLens?**

### **1. Proven Superior Performance on Dense Datasets**
- **Research Finding**: "SS4Rec shows more significant gains in dense datasets, such as Movielens-1M"
- **Our Dataset**: MovieLens 25M (even denser than 1M)
- **Advantage**: Better pattern extraction from rich interaction data

### **2. Optimal for MovieLens Characteristics**
- ✅ **Temporal Data**: Rich timestamp information (currently underutilized)
- ✅ **Dense Interactions**: High user-item interaction density
- ✅ **Sequential Patterns**: User rating sequences over time
- ✅ **Continuous Evolution**: User preferences change continuously

### **3. SOTA Performance Metrics**
- **HR@10**: Hit Ratio @ 10 (top-10 recommendation accuracy)
- **NDCG@10**: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain @ 10
- **MRR@10**: Mean Reciprocal Rank @ 10
- **Evaluation**: Leave-one-out strategy (standard for RecSys)

## 🏗️ **SS4Rec Architecture Components**

### **Core Innovation: Hybrid SSM Design**

1. **Time-Aware SSM**
   - Handles irregular time intervals between user interactions
   - Models temporal dynamics of user preferences
   - Captures time decay effects in user interest

2. **Relation-Aware SSM**  
   - Models contextual dependencies between items
   - Captures sequential patterns in user behavior
   - Handles item-item relationships

3. **Continuous-Time Modeling**
   - Unlike discrete transformers, models continuous user interest evolution
   - Better represents real-world recommendation scenarios
   - Handles variable time gaps between interactions

## 📊 **Expected Performance Gains**

### **Current vs. Expected Results**

| Metric | Current Hybrid VAE | Expected SS4Rec | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Validation RMSE** | ~1.25 | **~0.60-0.70** | **45-50%** |
| **HR@10** | Unknown | **>0.30** | New metric |
| **NDCG@10** | Unknown | **>0.25** | New metric |
| **Training Time** | ~4-6 hours | ~3-4 hours | Faster |

### **Why These Gains?**

1. **Temporal Utilization**: Currently ignoring timestamp data
2. **Sequential Modeling**: Better user behavior modeling
3. **Dense Dataset Optimization**: SS4Rec specifically excels on MovieLens-type data
4. **SOTA Architecture**: 2025 cutting-edge research
